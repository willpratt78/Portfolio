  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Having spent most of my adult life working in kitchens, I feel that it's time to take on a new challenge and learn a new skill set with all the trials and tribulations that have gone on in the world for the last few years. I have always had an interest in computers and software, had my high school not had a culinary program I stumbled upon that's what I was planning on studying and going into as a career. The fact that coding is getting to constantly solve different problems/puzzles and seeing direct results from that, which is also one of the reasons that rock climbing is my biggest hobby, keeps me engaged with the work and excited to take on new challenges. While it may not be apparent <em>at first</em> I think there are a lot of similarities in the <strong>structures of kitchens, software development, and the soft skills</strong> needed to perform both jobs.</p>
  <h3>Transferable soft skills from kitchens</h3>
  <div class="slideleft">
    <ol>
      <li>You work on your own project as an individual to create a complete product as a team.</li>
      <li>Having to find creative solutions to problems quickly when something unexpected happens.</li>
      <li>Working with different people with all kinds of backgrounds and potential language barriers.</li>
      <li>Constantly adjusting things to meet consumer demand but never really communicating with the consumer directly always through a 3rd party.</li>
      <li>Being a self-starter who will show up and get the job done without having someone watch them constantly</li>
      <li>Taking in constructive criticism well, and then apply it immediately upon receiving it.</li>
      <li>Knowing that the first time you approach something isn't always going to be the desired result and being willing to go back until it's right.</li>
    </ol>

  <h3>Personal Life</h3>
  <p>In my personal life, as stated above, I'm an avid rock climber. During outdoor season I try to get outside at least twice a month and I'm at the gym 3-5 times a week every week climbing, running, lifting weights, and doing yoga. Most of my time during the week is spent either going to the gym or cooking food after work. On the weekends when I get together with my friends we tend to do dinner parties, go to museums/art galleries, try new hiking spots, wander around town looking for new restaurants to explore, and play board games together. When the opportunity presents itself I love to travel, pre-pandemic I always tried to go somewhere new, preferably out of the country, every year, and is the main reason I took the job with Lindblad Expeditions having gotten to travel to 6 different countries over the course of my year there. Finding hidden coffee/tea shops to sit at and read for hours on end is one off  my greatest joys.</p>
