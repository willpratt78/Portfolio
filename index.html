    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Having spent most of my adult life working in kitchens, I feel that it's time to take on a new challenge and learn a new skill set with all the tirals and tribulations that have gone on in the world for the last few years. I have always had an interst in computers and software, had my highschool not had a culinary program that's what I would have chosen to go into as a career. I really enjoy that coding is getting to constantly solve different problems and puzzles and seeing direct results from that, which is also one of the reasons that rock climbing is my biggest hobby as that's just like solving a puzzle with you body. While it may not be apparent <em>at first</em> I think there are a lot of similarities in the <strong>structures of kitchens, software development and the soft skills</strong> needed to preform both jobs.</p>

    <h3>Transferable soft skills from kitchens</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>You work on your own project as an individual to create a complete product as a team.</li>
      <li>Having to find creative solutions to problems quickly when something unexpected happens.</li>
      <li>Working with different people with all kinds of backgrounds and language barries.</li>
      <li>Constantly adjusting things to meet consumer demand but never really communicating with the consumer directly always through a 3rd party.</li>
      <li>Being a self-starter who will show up and get the job done without having someone watch them constantly</li>
      <li>Being able to take constructive critisism and apply it immediatly upon reciving it.</li>
    </ol>
